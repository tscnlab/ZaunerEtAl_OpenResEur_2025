I don't much more mostly because I think further instances would be dependent on build quality or capability, like; IP water resistance rating etc..."
In what situations or activities do you think wearing the light logger might be difficult,collarpin,I think this is has difficulties in cold climates any situation were wearing multiple layers could cause coverage and outside layer is not available. it is more intrusive and eye catching so could be a problem for social contexts.
In what situations or activities do you think wearing the light logger might be difficult,glasses,I think in this age it is socially limiting at least until VR/ AR tools come around. I would not wear it to sleep. I would also be hesitant to wear it while working out.
In what situations or activities do you think wearing the light logger might be difficult,hatpin,I think this form factor limits the times the situation you could wear it since it would require a hat or a hair style it allow for it. I think it be difficult for working out due to high motion an impracticality of wearing a hat.
In what situations or activities do you think wearing the light logger might be difficult,neckloop,"I think with this design any high motion task working out, up down motions and lying on you back could cause irritation or the item falling off.  Also I see the design as easier to forget to use than the others."
In what situations or activities do you think wearing the light logger might be difficult,chestpin,The only situation or actives I see this design being difficult is in environment where your upper body rubs against surfaces like maybe rock-climbing are plumbing.
In what situations or activities do you think wearing the light logger might be difficult,necklace,The situations that I see the light logger being difficult here are still high active work outs were the logger could bounce and give bad reading. High temperatures activities like welding or cooking where having the logger in a place that can capture could lead to close contact with high heat sources.
In what situations or activities do you think wearing the light logger might be difficult,sleevecollar,I see the same issues as the pins. Clothing covering over this could make it difficult. Jobs where lifting is common might feel irritation.

It would also disrupt the appearance of some tops."
In what situations or activities do you think wearing the light logger might be difficult,glasses,"It would catch on the hair of anyone with long hair, be jostled easily, and would cause uneven weight on the glasses that could hurt or simply make the glasses go askew, making everyday activities uncomfortable.

In what situations or activities do you think wearing the light logger might be difficult,neckloop,During exercise. Possibly   while sitting depending on how it fits across the back.
In what situations or activities do you think wearing the light logger might be difficult,chestpin,Maybe during exercise or something where it might dislodge the sensor. Maybe depending on how it affixes to clothing as well.
In what situations or activities do you think wearing the light logger might be difficult,necklace,"During wet conditions, or if the bouncing of the sensor would not be good or irritating while exercising."
In what situations or activities do you think wearing the light logger might be difficult,sleevecollar,"During exercise, while wearing certain clothing, in general hard to keep in place without becoming too tight or bothersome."
"Please describe, in your own words, the placement of
the light logger in the body.",wrist,"While more convienent, I think the wrist might not be the best place to monitor light. because  you may place your hands under a desk, rest them on your knees, or your hands are in such a low position if hanging by your sides."
"Please describe, in your own words, the placement of
the light logger in the body.",collarpin,"Better than the wrist, but maybe something that recorded exposure on all sides would be better"
"Please describe, in your own words, the placement of
the light logger in the body.",glasses,"Fine for worward facing light capture, especially on the side its on. I really depends if exposure needs to be more whole body, or 4 sided, or just front facing."
"Please describe, in your own words, the placement of
the light logger in the body.",hatpin,"Again, it depends on where the light needs to be captured. if it                       needs to be all light on the body, then not good. If just front facing then not too bad. Maybe a little one sided."
"Please describe, in your own words, the placement of

"Please describe, in your own words, the placement of
the light logger in the body.",sleevecollar,"Only good for one side of the body, not total front facing, and maybe toomuch movement of the arm to be as effective"
"Can you envision and elaborate on alternative designs for light loggers, specifically focused on enabling continuous wear?",general,"It would help to know where the light needs to be captured. From  all sides of the body? Just front facing?  If all sides, it would need to be like a strip that goes around your head ideally. However who would want to wear that all the time unless you wore a cap?   If just front facing, I think a lanyard style is best ,  maybe one that can also be affixed to your shirt             if being stationary is a need.   A lanyard would enable you to easily remove it and put it back on, no restriction of movement, nor issues with clothing."

In what situations or activities do you think wearing the light logger might be difficult,wrist,"The main point is: if it is just a ligh logger, I will never use it because I already use a swatch so I can imagine myself with two different wearable. Focusing on this specific question, I think that if we are already used to wear smartwatch, there aren't difficult situation. Pheraps in the sea or in a swimming pool, but I think that it will be waterproof, isn't?"
In what situations or activities do you think wearing the light logger might be difficult,collarpin,"I think that it can be difficult if I'm doing physical exercise, because the likelihood to lost it is surely higher. Moreover, it can't be used if you are wearing a jumper or a coat, in general any clothes that hasn't a 'linear' collar."
In what situations or activities do you think wearing the light logger might be difficult,glasses,"If I don't need wearing glasses to see, I can use it only when I use sunglasses.  And if I need to wear glasses to see, I think that this type of light logger can be annoying in any situations."
In what situations or activities do you think wearing the light logger might be difficult,hatpin,"As for glasses, I not wear a cap in any situations of my life. I can use it just if it's cold and I'm outside."
In what situations or activities do you think wearing the light logger might be difficult,neckloop,This type of ligh logger can be lost anytime moving around both for a 'classic' walk and during exerices. It is almost always diffucult to weat it!
In what situations or activities do you think wearing the light logger might be difficult,chestpin,"I think that in this way it can be lost. Moreover it must be 'pinned' on a t-shirt or similar, I can't pin it on a coat. So it can be used inside, and not outside. During exercise can be diffucult because if you are using some specific equipment it can 'conflict' with light logger"
In what situations or activities do you think wearing the light logger might be difficult,necklace,"There are many situations in which it could be difficult to wear this type of ligh logger: for example in bycicle because this 'necklace' light logger will move around and not stay fixed on the t-shirt. This is the main reason because it could be difficult to use it in many situation, even on dinner or launch, there is the risk to dip it in your soup!"
In what situations or activities do you think wearing the light logger might be difficult,sleevecollar,"As for the first type of light logger, the point is: will it be just to light detection or this can be just one more functionality of a different kind of wearable? For example, if it is integrated in a sport wearable, it can be useful and not difficult to use. If I must wear it specifically, I think that in the most of public occasions it will be difficult to use it (for a fashion reason)"

In what situations or activities do you think wearing the light logger might be difficult,wrist,"Maybe during houshold tasks like washing the dishes or anything that contains water. Depending on wether it's waterproof or not, I would have to take it off."
In what situations or activities do you think wearing the light logger might be difficult,collarpin,I think I'd have sensory issues with this one. Feeling someting on this particular area on the body is nothing I'm used to and it probably would bother me. Also it'd be pretty visible for others because of the unusual placement.
In what situations or activities do you think wearing the light logger might be difficult,glasses,"Depending on what it would really look like it can easily mistaken for glasses with build-in camera. That could lead to problems. Also I'm not using glasses, so the feeling would bother me. It would be annoying with wearing masks, covid related. Also in the cold. And it's still pretty visible."
In what situations or activities do you think wearing the light logger might be difficult,hatpin,"First I need to wear a cap. In most of settings people are'nt wearing caps. And if so, this device probably is weighing a bit. I don't know how much, but depending on how much, that would be pretty annoying and really visible to others. Would not wear that."
In what situations or activities do you think wearing the light logger might be difficult,neckloop,"With this one I'm also not sure how much the sensory feeling would be of an issue. Also, the weight might be a problem again. But what would be a problem for sure is, since it needs to be exposed to light, you would have to change the position everytime you need to take off your jacket or whatever you are wearing. I think this would just be an unnecessary and annoying extra step to do. And - still depending on the weight, if it's just a little bit heavier, it could be a problem for people with chronic pain or pain in that particular region. It could also lead to more tension in this area, since it's such an unsual area to feel this form of weight. This could lead to neck or shoulder pain."
In what situations or activities do you think wearing the light logger might be difficult,chestpin,"Same problem with most of them: depending on the weight the sensory issues still occur. And could pull the shirt down, even if it's pretty light-weighted. I don't think it would look as inconspicuous as it does in the pictures. And same as before, you'd have to change the location of the device everytime you take off/putting on your jacket."
In what situations or activities do you think wearing the light logger might be difficult,necklace,"Still depending on weight if it's too much or not. I think this is socially more inconspicuous. During exercise it would be a problem because of the movement and of course depending on the kind of sport because it would be really dangerous or even forbidden, if you're training with a team. I personally would'nt like wearing something like that all the time. Also, you have to put it over your jacket if it needs to be exposed as much as possible. It would be pretty visible, especially in the winter."
In what situations or activities do you think wearing the light logger might be difficult,sleevecollar,"I wouldn't want to wear anything in that particular area. Would feel like measuring blood pressure. Also really visible. It'd be more outlay to produce something like that because human beings have vary in their measurements. It should be accessible to all people, this won't be a good choice. Also: what to do, if you aren't wearing a shirt? I wouldn't want that over a hoodie or jacket."

"Can you envision and elaborate on alternative designs for light loggers, specifically focused on enabling continuous wear?",general,"The watch would be the only logical fit for me, considering it needs to be exposed to light for as many hours as possible, being accessible for as many people, as possible. It's a feeling most people know from their day to day life. But if it's designed for long-term wear, that might be a problem for some people. There probably should be more than one design available.   You could think about a wristband, less of a watch-like design. That would be accessible to wear even if you're wearing a watch at the same time."
